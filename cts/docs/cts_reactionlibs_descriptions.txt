<p>
The reaction libraries are composed of generalized reaction schemes that compose a
reaction library for a given transformation process (e.g., abiotic hydrolysis, abiotic
reduction, and mammalian metabolism) that are based on specific examples
published in the peer-reviewed literature. Reaction libraries that allows us to
&quot;encode&quot; the known process science published in the peer-reviewed literature. The
reaction libraries are considered to be comprehensive based on the review of the
current literature; however, updates will be made as additional studies are published.
The encoding of process science is accomplished using Chemical Terms Language and
Smart Reaction SMILES strings through cheminformatics applications. The execution
of these reaction libraries provides dominant transformation pathways and products
for the chemical of interest as a function of environmental conditions.

<h3>Abiotic Hydrolysis Reaction Library</h3>
<p>
The current version of the Abiotic Hydrolysis Reaction Library contains 24 reaction
schemes. In the documentation page, left click a reaction scheme to view the
generalized reaction scheme, supporting reaction rules for reactivity, selectivity and
exclusion, as well as example transformation pathways and associated references.
Scroll to the bottom of the library documentation page to view a table showing the
rank assignments for each scheme in the library.

<h3>Abiotic Reduction Reaction Library</h3>
<p>
The current version of the Abiotic Reduction Reaction Library contains eight reaction
schemes. In the documentation page, left click a reaction scheme to view the
generalized reaction scheme, supporting reaction rules for reactivity, selectivity and
exclusion, as well as example transformation pathways and associated references.

<h3>Direct Photolysis Reaction Library</h3>
<p>
There are currently 154 reaction schemes in the Direct Photolysis Reaction Library.
There are ranked and unranked versions of the library. The unranked library generates
all possible phototransformation products and should not be run with other libraries.
In the documentation pages for the ranked and unranked libraries, left click a reaction
scheme to view the generalized reaction scheme, supporting reaction rules for
reactivity, selectivity and exclusion, as well as example transformation pathways and
associated references. Scroll to the bottom of the ranked library documentation page
to view a table showing the rank assignments for each scheme in the library.

<h3>Spontaneous Reaction Library</h3>
<p>
The Spontaneous Reaction Library contains aqueous reactions that occur very quickly
and is intended to be combined with other CTS reaction libraries. It was developed to
capture the rapid transformation of intermediates that form due to other
transformation processes (e.g., hydrolysis or photolysis). The current version of
Spontaneous Reaction Library contains one reaction scheme.

<h3>Human Phase 1 Metabolism Reaction Library</h3>
<p>
The Human Phase 1 Metabolism Reaction Library contains 159 reaction schemes
based on cytochrome P450 (CYP450) phase one biotransformations. This reaction
library was developed by ChemAxon. The reaction library is proprietary, so details of
the reaction schemes cannot be viewed.
